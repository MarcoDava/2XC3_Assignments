1. generally some functions will be slower. however, it is not a good idea to not have any functions for the sake of faster time. it is important to have a modular structure even though it may sacrifice some time. Some functions will be unnecessary,like the checkfactor because it is not doing much. these functions are ok to remove.

2. it depends on the function it self. if it is a complicated function it might be better to declare it normally as it is more readable and easier to understand. however, if you have a small function, it may be better to parametize.

3. by improving the algorithm the response was a lot faster. there were a lot less comparisons on primes4.c then primes3,c which allowed for a fater program

4. When a function is simple, such as a simple if statement, it can be ok to keep it in a main function, however, as much as possible, it might be a better idea to keep things modular to allow readability.
